# Medical-CNN
A research project for extending the CNN to fields of x-ray imaging and labeling diagnosis for specific features in the x-ray.

# Goals #
To create a CNN(maybe through transfer learning via a VGG) that would be able to read in the x-ray results as a temporal medium and classify into the classes
of severity.

# Extra Goals #
To allow for image captioning using an RNN(LSTM) model that is attached to the end of a CNN.

## Milestones ##
- Finished data io? Nope
- Finished preprocessing? Nope
- Finished implementing a naive net? Nope
- Finished training the naive net? Nope
- Optional but recommended step : Finished SMOTE/data augmentation? Nope
  - Note: This one is a bit hard since we can't classify the diagnosis ourselves.
- Finished importing over a transfer learned net? Nope
- Finished training the transfer learned net? Nope
- Finished implementing a naive RNN? Nope
- Finished importing over a transfer learned LSTM? Nope
- Finished training the LSTM? Nope
